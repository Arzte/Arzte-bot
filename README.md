## Running arzte

Download the latest release of arzte, then extract the bin file. Copy settings.example.toml to settings.toml, and set your Discord token with your own bot token.

```token = "MTc1MDQ4MTc0MzMzOTg0NzY4.DxQwWQ.7TYu1RMBpUkTFlkxhYHsqR_89Nw"``` (not a real token don't worry)

After setting your bot token you can then start arzte bot, simple run this command ``` ./arzte ```
